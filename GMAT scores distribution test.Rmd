# Check if GMAT scores are normally distributed. My recent scores are: total 680, quant 43, verbal 41, IR 5). And my reported percentiles are: 82, 47, 93, 54 respectively. Means and stds are from the GMAC website https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat/after-the-exam/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-gmat-percentile-ranking-means

# See the reported distributions in pdf files attached.

# Check total score (680, 82) distribution first - it's close to reported percentile but not equal.
qnorm(0.82, 561.27, 119.31) # qnorm returns a score that should correspond to a given percentile for normal distr.
pnorm(680, 561.27, 119.31) # pnorm returns the Z-value of the given score for normal distribution.

# Check quant, verbal and IR

# Quant (score 43, percentile 47) - significantly different results
qnorm(0.47, 39.93, 10.53)
pnorm(43, 39.93, 10.53)

# Verbal (score 41, percentile 93) - very close to reported data
qnorm(0.93, 27.04, 9.24)
pnorm(41, 27.04, 9.24)

# IR (score 5, percentile 54) - different values
qnorm(0.54, 4.29, 2.09)
pnorm(5, 4.29, 2.09)

# Looks like the total and verbal scores might follow the nearly normal distribution. 

# The means of the reported distributions are always lower that the medians, thus we deal with the left skewed distributions. Also, the distributions here are not follow the 68-95-99.7% rule.

```{r}

# Tasks for week 4

qnorm(0.1, 21, 5)

qnorm(0.2, 77, 5)

# Calculate the number of combinations (when the order doesn't matter) - choose k from n

choose(9, 2)
choose(100, 5)

# Binomial distribution
# Only 13% of employees are engaged at work. Among a random sample of 10 employees calculate the probability that exactly 8 of them are engaged at work.  

dbinom(8, size = 10, p = 0.13)

# the prob is very small, obviously

dbinom(2, size = 10, p = 0.13)
