# Check if GMAT scores are normally distributed. My recent scores are: total 680, quant 43, verbal 41, IR 5). And my reported percentiles are: 82, 47, 93, 54 respectively. Means and stds are from the GMAC website https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat/after-the-exam/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-gmat-percentile-ranking-means

# See the reported distributions in pdf files attached.

# Check total score (680, 82) distribution first - it's close to reported percentile but not equal.
qnorm(0.82, 561.27, 119.31) # qnorm returns a score that should correspond to a given percentile for normal distr.
pnorm(680, 561.27, 119.31) # pnorm returns the Z-value of the given score for normal distribution.

# Check quant, verbal and IR

# Quant (score 43, percentile 47) - significantly different results
qnorm(0.47, 39.93, 10.53)
pnorm(43, 39.93, 10.53)

# Verbal (score 41, percentile 93) - very close to reported data
qnorm(0.93, 27.04, 9.24)
pnorm(41, 27.04, 9.24)

# IR (score 5, percentile 54) - different values
qnorm(0.54, 4.29, 2.09)
pnorm(5, 4.29, 2.09)

# Looks like the total and verbal scores might follow the nearly normal distribution. 

# The means of the reported distributions are always lower that the medians, thus we deal with the left skewed distributions. Also, the distributions here don't follow the 68-95-99.7% rule.

# Binomial distribution
# Only 13% of employees are engaged at work. Among a random sample of 10 employees calculate the probability that exactly 8 of them are engaged at work.  

dbinom(8, size = 10, p = 0.13)

# the prob is very small, obviously

dbinom(2, size = 10, p = 0.13)

# While it is often assumed that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability of having a boy is slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 children. What is the probability that exactly 2 of them will be boys?

dbinom(2, 3, 0.51)

# Your friend is about to begin an introductory chemistry course at his university. The course has collected data from students on their study habits for many years, and the professor reports that study times (in hours) for the final exam closely follow a normal distribution with mean 24 and standard deviation 4. What percentage of students study 34 hours or more?

pnorm(33.5, mean = 24, sd = 4, lower.tail = FALSE)

# The National Vaccine Information Center estimates that 90% of Americans have had the disease chickenpox by the time they reach adulthood. What is the probability that exactly 92 out of 100 randomly sampled American adults had chickenpox during childhood?

dbinom(92, 100, 0.9)

# Your boss is a biologist who needs wood samples from long-leaf pine trees with a fungal disease which is only visible under a microscope, and she sends you on an assignment to collect the samples. She wants at least 50 different diseased samples. She tells you that approximately 28% of long-leaf pine trees currently have the fungal disease. If you sample 160 long-leaf pine trees at random, what is the probability youâ€™ll have at least 50 diseased samples to return to your boss? (Use the normal approximation to calculate this probability and chose the closest answer to the question.)
